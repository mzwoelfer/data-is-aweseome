# 🚀 Data is Awesome
Answering questions with opinionated `DATA STORIES` and `VISUALS` in `self contained projects`.

**🎯 Goals**: Extend Python3, data aggregation and story telling skills.

Focus on making your audience understand the subject at hand.

Read more about the [❓️Why](docs/Purpose%20and%20Why.md)?
⚠️Lots of text!


## 📏 Rules
- 🔓 Datasources must be `publicly` available
- 🇬🇧 The working language is `English`
- 🪜 `No paywalls`, or provide a ladder to climb over ;)
- 🔄 `Script`(s) for data gathering, processing and visualization
- 📝 Provide README.md to `explain thoughts` and technical steps
- 😉 Use Emojis and don't take yourself to seriously

git clone git@github.com:zwoefler/Data-is-aweseome.git
cd data-is-awesome/

cd <PROJECT_OF_INTEREST>
# READ THE README
cat README.md
```


## 🏗️ ToDos
- [X] Add CONTRIBUTING.md + rules
- [X] Add LICENSE
- [X] Refine Mission statement
- [X] Script to get started with new project easily!
- [ ] Section for `Developers` and `non technical` people
- [ ] Pipeline to check if everything is there (docs, scripts, etc.)
- [X] Include `WHY` section in docs/README
- [ ] `External Data storage` - not all in the Git repo
- [ ] Docs - for (sub)project with Tutorial, How-To, requirements
- [ ] Add Docker containers per project to run data visuals
- [ ] Every project with it's own visualization?


## 📊 Data
All Data-Projects have a README answering the following questions:
- WHERE is the data valid? (City, Country, Continent, Celestial Body)
- WHEN is the data valid? (Far gone time period, valid today + estimates in the future?
- WHO ordered/comissioned/gathered the data?
- HOW was the data gathered? (Survey (participants), counting hand vs. technical)
- WHAT is the public source? A link or links with an explanation should the data be aggreageted.


## 🚧 Problems
- Project is to big, contains lots of raw data files - find a better way!
