# Data is Awesome
Repository for all kinds of data visualizations

At some point, Ill build a webpage to display all that stuff!

## Best Practices
- Docker-Container, or explanation how to run Python-Scripts
- Should work from 0-100. Including Data-Sources and mangling!


# Plans
- Directors & Executives stock holdings per holding. over time visualization + planned or unplanned sale
- Graph the tax revenue/loss per hectar in a given city
- 

## To DO
- New "Project" script that creates new folder, installs a python virtual env,
creates a README.md, a requirements.txt (jupyter, pandas) and a "develop.sh" script
