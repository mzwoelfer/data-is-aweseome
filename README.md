# Data is Awesome
Repository for data visualizations of all kinds.

Whatever comes to mind.

### 📏 Rules
- Every Datasource must be publicly available
- No paywalls
- A script must give access from data download to final JSON-file
- Each datafolder must store the relevant data in a data/ directory (Save CI time)



# Projects
- Bundeshaushalt since 1991. An overview of the spending by the german federal government since reunited GERMANY! (There seems to be no propper data available)
- City spending by sections and over the years by reading data from the PDFs provided as "Haushatsplan"


# ❓️ Questions
## WHy TF JSON?
Easy to manage, don't know beforehand what data is available and don't want to use a database...
JSON is good enough and well supported
