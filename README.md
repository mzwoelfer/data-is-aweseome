## 📏 Rules
- 🔓 `Public` datasources
- 🪜 `No paywall`, or provide a ladder to climb over ;)
- 🇬🇧 `English` is the working language
- 🔄 `Scripts` must include the full pipeline:
    - `Data gathering`
    - `Processing`
    - `Visualization`
- 📝 `Provide READMEs` on how to use, explaining thoughts and technical steps
- 😉 `Emojis` help the understanding

## 🏗️ ToDos

## 📊 Data
All Data-Projects have a `README` answering the following questions:
- `WHERE` is the data valid? (City, Country, Continent, Celestial Body)
- `WHEN` is the data valid? (Far gone time period, valid today + estimates in the future?
- `WHO` ordered/comissioned/gathered the data?
- `HOW` was the data gathered? (Survey (participants), counting hand vs. technical)
- `WHAT` is the public source? A link or links with an explanation should the data be aggreageted.


## 🚧 Problems
- [ ] Project is to big. Over 9GB!
    - contains raw data files - find a better way!

- `DOCS`: Docs for the entire project, discussisons, reference, design descisison, etc.
- `TEMPLATES`: Templates 🤷🏽
- `WEBPAGE`: Present the `data-is-awesome` data as articles on the web
