### Data Explanations
#### Absolute vs. Percentage?
A company like Meta might grow slowly at just under 3% new User Account growth.
But those 3% are about 100 million accounts created yearly. The scale is massive!

#### Average or Median?
Income data can be heavily skewed.
An increase in average salary of 10% can mean nothing to most people in that population.
Looking at the median, the value in the middle, might reveal massiv income increases went only to a hand full of people.

This effect also works in the oposite direction.
Average CO2-Emissions for some energy-sources is usually lower than the median, indicating there are a few heavy outliers!
