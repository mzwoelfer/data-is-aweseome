# ‚ùìÔ∏è Purpose and Why
Many unanswered questions meet too much unnecessary information.
The problem is a shortage of intutive and easy to understand knowledge.

Each data project here checks at least one of the following:
- Answers a research question
- Learning a new feature/skill
- Creating a dataset for later use

## üíæ The technical Why
Build reliable and reusable tools to:
- Collect
- Process and
- Visualize Data

The Vision os to create a tool-suite to collect data from different source such as:
- URLs
- Webpages / HTML
- PDFs
- Pictures / Videos
- Data Providers / Databases
and visualize them

Normies must be able to use the data as well.
So ideally give them somthing to analyze in Excel.

## üß© Data is only part of understanding!
Asking questions is valuable, trying to answer them is the hard part.
Writing Code is just a necessary evil to get there!

## üí© Most data viz is bullshit
Most dataviz is nothing more than a 5 second insight.
Looking through reddit pages like (DataIsBeautiful)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/] you find lots of nice graphics.
What is missing is a larger dataset to connect the dots and valuable insights.

The `Breaking Bad` Episode ratings scoreboard looks nice, but has no usage beyond "hey, that was the most popular episode".
Same is true for companies Income statement flow charts. They look nicer than the blue-white SEC tables, thats for sure.
However, more valuable is the answer to questions like:
- "Are the onetime items recurring?"
- "how does this compare to the last reports?"


## ü§î Why be opinionated?
Stating clearly, this is **NOT A NEUTRAL DATA SOURCE**
Data is used to answer **specific questions** or settle **arguments**.
Analysis and visualization are influenced by the question's context.
Multiple data sources with differing viewpoints and limitations require clear explanation.

Example:
    Question: Why more accidents on a certain Autobahn segment?
    Hypothesis: Lifted speed limit leads to more crashes.
    Insight: Most crashes occur at lower speeds.
    Conclusion: Overcapacity, not speed, is most likely the primary cause.
