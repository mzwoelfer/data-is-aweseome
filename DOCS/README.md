# ❓️ Purpose and Why
There is a shortage of intutive and easy to understand knowledge.

Each data project checks at least one of the following:
- Answers a research question
- Learning a new feature/skill
- Creating a dataset for later use

## 🚀 The Vision
Create a suite of tools to collect data from different source.

## 💾 The technical Why
Build reliable and reusable tools to:
- Collect
- Process and
- Visualize Data

Collect data from:
- URLs
- Webpages / HTML
- PDFs
- Pictures / Videos
- Data Providers / Databases
and visualize them

Normies must be able to use the data in Excel.

## 🤔 Why be opinionated?
**THI IS NOT A NEUTRAL DATA SOURCE**
Data is used to answer **specific questions** or settle **arguments**.

# 🚀 Create a Data Project

## 🏗️ Prerequisites
- Python3.8 or higher (Tested until 3.11)
- Cloned this repo
- in the root directory of this project `data-is-awesome`

```bash
# Create new Project folder
mkdir <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Add necessary files
touch requirements.txt
touch README.md
mkdir data/

# Create Python Environment
python3 -m venv Env
source Env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧩 Aspects of your project
All steps must be reproducable!

**Data Collection**: A simple reproducable way to gather the data
**Data Processing**: Cleaning duplicates, usable data schema
**Visualization**: Script to load your cleaned data and visualize
