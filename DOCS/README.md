Data Projects should have a clear stroyline to:
- catch peoples interest
- willingness to read/understand
- In the best case continue reading on the subject
What good is a stroy nobody reads?

The data and visuals are a way of presenting a deeper meaning!

From YouTube and many social media pages I know (asume) the following to be true:
- Kick ass title (Catches peoples attention)
- First 5 seconds need to meat expectations
-




Questionaire and Process:
- Who is the story for? (Yourself, City, Friends, Family, Interest Group...)

1. Come up with a title
2. Define the first outline, idealy with a picture or visual in mind!
3. So what? - Who would really be interested?
