# Gr√ºne Hessen Landesparteitag SpeechAnalyzer
Kinda goal is to paste a youtube video, get the speech as text and offer a frontend to edit and select the text and run analysis.
Analysis could be:
- Counted words
- Most similar words being used
- Automatic topic and sentiment analysis

Want a frontend to put YouTube link, select your range of time for the video, ge tthe text for that area.

1. Basic Webpage with list of places ons list and links to speeches (only text)
2. Include timestamps in speech
3. Embedd Video on YouTube starting at that timestamp
4. Word-Count overview
5. Summary Word-Count with sentiment (renewable energies, wind and solar, etc. are one group!)



## Do CI
1. getSpeechesInfo.py
2. transcribeSpeeches.py
4. includeYouTubeID.py
3. summarizeSpeeches.py
