## 🌍️ Languages:
#8orHigherBro
Use `Python3.8` or higher and adhere to the `PEP 8` Python Styleguide.
To adhere to the standards use `pylint` or `autopep8` in your editor and development process (see **Resources** below).

**What is PEP8?**
A standard for readable Python Code.
Tools like `pylint` and `autopep8` help you make your code look nice.

Generally these rules apply:
- Linelength <80 characters. Docstrings 72
- 4 spaces per indentaion level
- 3 indentation levels max


**Why Python3**:
- Supported on major platforms
- Simple to read & write
- Versatile: Data gathering, cleaning, visualizations, etc.

Why Python3.8?
- Ubuntu 20.04 user here.
Will be bumped in the future!

**Resources**:
- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
- [Autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)
