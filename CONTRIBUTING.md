Welcome to the `Data-is-Awesome` project!
Your contributions are highly valued and encourage you to get involved in various ways:

- 📖 **Docs:** Contribute to documentation.
- 💻 **Code/Features:** Enhance existing features or introduce new ones.
- 🐛 **Bug-Fixes:** Identify and fix bugs.
- 👥 **Connections/Peers:** Provide contacts and collaborate with peers.
- 💡 **Presenting Ideas/Wishes:** Share your thoughts and ideas.

The project is designed to be easily accessible on GitHub.
A simple clone grants you access to all project resources, including `documentation`, `contributions`, and `ideas`, available as Markdown files INSIDE the project.

Therefore most text-based info MUST be included as Markdown files INSIDE this project!

## 💡 Idea for a new project?
Add a file to `docs/backlog` or create a new folder and start developing.

Your Feature README.md must include:
- Research questions / Point of interest!
- How to run
- What it does / explanation
- Sources / Links

## 🌍️ Languages:
#8orHigher
Use `Python3.8` or higher and adhere to the `PEP 8` Python Styleguide.
To adhere to the standards you can use `pylint` or `autopep8` in your editor and development process (see **Resources** below).

**What is PEP8?**
A standard for Python Code that makes it readable and rule for how it should look.
The tools like `pylint` and `autopep8` can help you with that.

Generally these rules apply:
- Linelength <80 characters. Docstrings 72
- 4 spaces per indentaion level
- 3 indentation levels max


**Why Python3**:
Python3 is:
- Supported on major platforms
- Simple to read & write
- Versatile: Data gathering, cleaning, visualizations, etc.

Why Python3.8?
- Ubuntu 20.04 user here.
Will be bumped in the future!

**Resources**:
- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
- [Autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)


## 📦️ New Features
A new feature must adhere to the folder strucutre at the end of this chapter.
Your fueature must be documented, and be able to be executed repeatadly.
Do not use hidden or not publicly accessable resources, or provide a higher ladder ;)

ALWAYS include a `README.md` for your Feature including the following segments, at least a brief explanation and how to run:
- Title of your project
- Research Qeustion / Why
- How it works / is implemented
- Usage: Commands to run this project
- Overview of the project folder, users should know
- Resources: Links to similar projects or inspiration: articles, videos, etc.
